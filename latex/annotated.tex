\section{SceneGraphTest Data Structures}
Here are the data structures with brief descriptions:\begin{CompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf GroupNode} (This is a simple grouping node that is used to gather nodes together it implementation of setState and draw are the default empty it is node thats name captures the semantics of grouping other nodes )}{\pageref{classGroupNode}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf ListGraphVisitor} (This class list the node in the order they would be encountered depth first and builds a formatted string using newline and tab characters to show the structure of the graph it follows a variant of the visitor desing pattern )}{\pageref{classListGraphVisitor}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf SceneGraph} (This class is the scene graph )}{\pageref{classSceneGraph}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf SceneGraphNode} (This class is the base class for all the scene graph nodes )}{\pageref{classSceneGraphNode}}{}
\end{CompactList}
